1)To have a better view of zoom functionality you need to upload image equal or greater than 800*800 pixels

2)template/catalog/product/view/media.phtml file will be ignored and the one in the extension will be used for the zoom function to work on the product page. So if you have customized your media.phtml file, you will need to copy your custom code and paste it in this "new" file located at /design/frontend/default/default/template/zoom/media.phtml. For help, please get in touch with us at magento@cueblocks.com

3)This extension will work for simple,configurable,bundled,virtual and grouped products.
